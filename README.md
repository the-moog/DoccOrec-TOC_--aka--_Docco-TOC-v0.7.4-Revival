**This is (er, hopefully?...) the same code as previously released as Docco-TOC v0.7.4. and since long lost to the great /dev/null**  
**I renamed it as 'DoccOrec-TOC' v7.0.5 so to express that it may not be the same as the missing 0.7.4 release and to prevent**  
**accidental inclusion by the unwary.**

_As for the name?...from Wikipedia: An **Orek** (Örek in_ [_Turkic folklore_](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkic_folklore&action=edit&redlink=1)) _is an animated corpse_ [_brought back to life,_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necromancy) _by mystical means..._

**Docco-TOC** is a fork of Docco that adds a simple table-of-contents to generated documentation.

**DoccOrec-TOC** is a resurection of release v0.7.4 of the Docco-TOC project from circa 2015.

Docco is a quick-and-dirty, hundred-line-long, literate-programming-style documentation generator.

_All trace of this package at v0.7.4 was removed from all of github, npm and yarn._

The github page ~jashkenas.github.com/docco/~  points you to to visit jashkenas.github.io?  
....which redirects to \<ashkenas.com> and is some sort of pointless .js joke page...

\_It was not even in the 'black hole' that is the [_Wayback Machine_](http://web.archive.org/web/20221226110607/https://github.com/jashkenas/docco/tags) _as it jumps_  
_from 7.0 to 8.1 with the more recent captures incomplete._

_But, after a bit of searching it was found here:_  
[_https://runkit-packages.com/18.x.x/1709230338381/docco-toc/README_](https://runkit-packages.com/18.x.x/1709230338381/docco-toc/README)

_And, as I needed v0.7.4 to build an old project without making_  
_changes, I recovered this from caches of https://npm.runkit.com/docco-toc_

_NB: This has been recovered for documentation purposes only_  
_and as the LICENSE file of the time indicates I am permittd to,_  
_I have made this available again._

_I am sure that there was for a reason for it vanishing, so:_

_**If at all possible I suggest you DO NOT USE!!**_  
_**Instead maybe find another,**_ [_**more up-to-date package**_](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco/releases/tag/0.9.1) (e.g. v0.9.1)_**...**_
